###  NVIDIA Clara™ Parabricks®
NVIDIA introduced the Clara Parabricks software suite for performing analysis of NGS DNA and RNA data. It delivers results at blazing fast speeds and low cost. Clara Parabricks can analyze 30x WGS data in under 25 minutes on a single 8-GPU server, instead of 30 hours for traditional CPU-based methods. Its output matches commonly used software, making it simple to verify the accuracy of the results.

Clara Parabricks software provides at least an order of magnitude acceleration in compute time while generating identical outputs and reducing analysis costs. Clara Parabricks is available free on NVIDIA GPU Cloud (NGC) and can be easily deployed on Azure GPU based virtual machines (VM).

Clara Parabricks provides optimal performance for multiple Microsoft Azure instance types and can be used out of the box for essential bioinformatics needs. Currently, the Clara Parabricks accelerated analysis tools start from FASTQ files and perform alignment through variant calling and expression analysis, including QC tools for both types of outputs. The suite of tools can be used to support end-to-end workflows for germline, somatic and RNA-Seq pipelines, providing the flexibility to meet the individual needs of most projects. The tools can also be used individually, as drop-in replacements for steps in existing workflows.
